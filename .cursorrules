# Cursor AI Rules for the Project

## Project Overview
This is a Nuxt 4 project with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Nuxt Content 3. All code should follow the ESLint configuration defined in `eslint.config.mjs`.

## Code Style and Formatting Rules

### ESLint Compliance
- ALWAYS follow the ESLint rules defined in `eslint.config.mjs`
- Pay special attention to Vue template formatting rules:
  - Use 2-space indentation for HTML attributes
  - Max 3 attributes per line for single-line elements
  - For multiline elements: 1 attribute per line, first attribute on new line
  - Proper closing bracket placement (never on new line for multiline)

### Vue Component Standards
- Use composition API with `<script setup>`
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
- Use proper Vue 3 patterns and best practices
- Follow the existing component structure in the project

### File Structure
- Components go in `app/components/`
- Pages go in `app/pages/`
- Content goes in `content/`
- Server API routes go in `server/api/`
- Utilities go in `app/utils/` or `utils/`

### Naming Conventions
- Vue components: PascalCase (e.g., `ProjectCard.vue`)
- Files and directories: kebab-case
- Variables and functions: camelCase
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

### Import and Dependencies
- Use the existing dependencies listed in `package.json`
- Prefer Nuxt auto-imports when available
- Use relative imports for local components and utilities

## Code Generation Guidelines
- Always check existing code patterns before generating new code
- Ensure generated code passes ESLint validation
- Maintain consistency with existing component architecture
- Include proper TypeScript types when applicable
- Follow the project's existing CSS and styling approach

## Quality Standards
- Code must be production-ready
- Include proper error handling
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Follow accessibility best practices for Vue components
- Ensure responsive design considerations

## Testing and Validation
- Run ESLint before considering code complete
- Verify that generated code integrates properly with existing Nuxt/Vue setup
- Test components in the context of the existing project structure
