***Lorem ipsum*** (/ˌlɔː.rəm ˈɪp.səm/ *LOR-əm IP-səm*) is a dummy or placeholder text commonly used in graphic design, publishing, and web development. Its purpose is to permit a page layout to be designed, independently of the copy that will subsequently populate it, or to demonstrate various fonts of a typeface without meaningful text that could be distracting.

*Lorem ipsum* is typically a corrupted version of *De finibus bonorum et malorum*, a 1st-century BC **text** by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words are the truncation of [dolorem]() *ipsum* ("pain itself").

Versions of the *Lorem ipsum* text have been used in typesetting since the 1960s, when advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets popularized it.\[1] *Lorem ipsum* was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted *Lorem ipsum*,\[2] as have many LaTeX packages,\[3]\[4]\[5] web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.
