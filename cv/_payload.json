Это определенного размера работа - 1,98 м в длину, помещена на уровне центральной точки 175 см от пола. Размеры продиктованы моими биометрическими данными как масса не охватываемая моим телом, это тот предел, который я почти могу схватить, но он больше. Речь идёт об ускользающем понятии, которое, с одной стороны, мне близко, ясно, от которого я не могу отказаться в каких-то ситуациях; с другой стороны, это понятие я не могу удержать, оно все равно обречено на программный сбой. В самом слове уже заложен неоднозначный контекст, концепт. Weißrussland - буквальный перевод: белая русская земля. Это слово становится символичным для понимания всей культурной ситуации, того, как одна культура, в данном случае немецкая, может заимствовать из другой, русской, мысль о третьей культуре, о белорусской. Спрашивается, что же, собственно, в ней самой остается аутентичного? В этом весь трагизм имени, русского слова, написанного готикой, которое опять же накладывается на тему события: выставка была посвящена 65-летию окончания Второй мировой войны. Mне было интересно поместить эту работу в контекст. С одной стороны, это контекстуальная, почти литературная, культурно-историческая проекция. С другой - шрифт, то, как он выглядит, как выстроен, его масштаб, массы, пропорции, пространство играют для меня большую роль.
